## Archival Records

### Mason Family File #277
* Family files are genealogical notes families donate to the library after research. Sometimes they are a massive waste of time and sometimes they are a goldmine. Just tell the staff you want family file #277 and they will know what's up. 

**We have secondary family files for Armistead. That means Armistead is mentioned a few times in the file as either extended family or family friends. The staff will be glad to grab these if you want to look. 

### Rust Family Papers M-087
- Rust family is a huge family in this area and the person who donated the files was a man named Armistead Thomas Mason Rust. I like the three family names you are looking for in one kid's name so it might be worth a look to see if he is family and has any additional family information. The collection runs from 1791-2009 so you might be interested in a quick look. Here is the link to the reference guide: http://www.leesburgva.gov/Home/ShowDocument?id=13439
