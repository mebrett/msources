My Dr Brother

Burlington June 7th 1790

Let me thank you my Dr Sir for the assistance you so generously gave me, I ought much sooner to have acknowledged it, but be assured my silence has not proceeded from the want of a due sense of the obligation you have laid me under, but to a variety of circumstances, which rendered it, almost impossible, for me, to do it sooner, it is owing, to your generosity, that I am again settled; I am now fixed at Burlington, where I am to remain this year, by which time, it will be sold. my plan then is, to rent a small place in the neighbourhood, & hope with industry & oeconomy I shall be able to seport my Children that are with me - your welcome favour of the 28 of Decr is now before me, & I am fully of your opinion, respecting my Dr James; & chearfully acquiesce in what ever plan you may think proper, to adopt for him; well knowing you will do that, which is best for him you have been miss-inform'd, as to its being, the occupation pitched on, by his Dr father - his plan was to have given him, as well as the others a liberal education & when arrived to years, he intended to have given them, a free choices as to their occupation & as we were situated in Norfolk, he often said, it was most probably, our sons would be sailors, it being a profession, much adopted by the youth of that place - let me intreat you my Dr Sir to write me from time to time, your sentiments respecting my Dr Boy, be candid & free & give me your real opinion of him - my little family unite with me, in love & affection, to my sister & your self.
