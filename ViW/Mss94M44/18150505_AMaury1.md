[in pencil] Aunt Anne ([illegible] side) Maury

I was much pleas'd my dear Ann, with your affectionate letter, which was so well executed, that I am sure you have been a very industrious little girl since you were put to school, & by continuing this rapid progress in your improvements you will, no doubt, give your Parents a great deal of pleasure, as well as your other connexions. As there is now a free intercourse between the two countrys, I hope you will write again soon, when you must tell me something about your Papam Mama, & Brothers as it always gives me pleasure to hear from such near & dear connexions. We shou'd be very much gratified, my dear little God-daughter, to see you in this Country, where I cou'd introduce you to your old Uncles & Aunts, & a large circle of cousins, many of whom, I think, you wou'd be pleas'd to get acquainted with - but the distance between us forbids me, even, ,to flatter myself that I shall ever enjoy that pleasure - your Papa tells me you are seldom indulg'd with a visit to his house, but when you are, I suppose your Mama has a variety of good [nugs] prepar'd for you & your Brothers, where I am sure you must form a happy little circle. Oh! how I shou'd be delighted to see you all with your Papa & Mama - but as this pleasure is not to be accomplish'd I must content myself with offering you & your Borthers the love & best wishes of

your affect Aunt
