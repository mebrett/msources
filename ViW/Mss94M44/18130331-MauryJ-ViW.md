My dear James

Finding you still are nervous, your Mother &  myself are desirous of your returning to your native air, where we think you will soon recover; and I have written Mr Jay on the subject. I have some expectation of being in London within a few days; &, if so, I shall either call, or send, for you. If I do not go up, I shall avail of some friend coming this way to take you with him. I therefore request you to be prepared whenever you may be called for.

All here are well & join in love & best wishes to you & Will. Give my love to Will & thank him for his letter by today's post. 

yr affc father
