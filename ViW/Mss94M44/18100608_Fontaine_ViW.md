James Maury Esqr

My Dear Brother

My last was of the 26th past, two days after which I received your several favors of the 20 & 21 March & 23 April, with their respective inclosures, for which I am thankfull. I note the opinion of Mr Pinkney which ought to be well founded, and perhaps is so, but it appears to be quite at variance with that of Lord Ellenbrough, which I some time ago extracted from a London Paper – It is however probable that the British Rule may make a distinction, between debts contracted in that Country & those originating in a Foreign Country. The Claim on which his Lordship decided was that of Aquella Brown of Baltimore, where it evidently did originate – The old claims [on me] may perhaps be considered as Contracted in England, they being for Goods Imported from that Country – I should very much like to know how how far these two situations are considered to vary from each other, if they differ at all.

If nothing more desirable shall present between this and October next and there be a Continuance of Free intercourse between this country & England, I shall make a begining at the [Steming] business, which I consider attended with little or no risk, indeed I recollect no instance in which it has failed to be productive where common attention was given, and a tolerable knowledge of Tobacco possessed. 

After what has already occured in our Commercial transactions I can with little confidence look to you for that aid, which under other Circumstances I should have no doubt of being freely given, If however you can have confidence enough to give me a Modest Credit at my Commencement, I believe you may be assured that if it be used at all, it will not be abused – I shall have nothing to do in the sale of Goods, and ‘tis intended that the greater part, if not all the Tobacco I may [stem] shall go to your Markett. If I can get from Congress what is Justly due to me, I shall have a few hundred Dolalrs left after pyaing yr claim and some other small ones, if otherwise I shall not have a cent but what I may be aided with by my Friends – In our political concerns we have nothing of Interest to Offer further than hath appeared in our public Prints, by which you will see the wonderfull changes that have taken place in the States of New York, Massachussets, &C &C

We are all anxiously looking for the arrival of the Frigate John Adams in hopes that after her long detention she may perhaps bring glad tidings.   Our friend Col Waler Died leaving about enough to pay his Debts, he left no Will, so that if there be any thing left it goes to his Grand Daughter Mis Nelson who lives at Belvoir.  I learn with much concern that our Nephew Francis Fontaine is about to be married to Matilda Fry, Grand Daughter to your old Friend Harry Fry, who for ought I know may be a charming Woman but she she happens to be worth nothing and there are five or six Sisters who will be dependant on whichever of them that may be first provided for – he is however Enterprizing and industrious & may therefore still do well.  Since I am on this subject I must not omit to inform you that Mrs Bromfield has at last consented to take our Friend Col Willis by the hand, he is to give the moderate annuity of £50 money, and some other matters, that may in all amount to about 500 Drs a year for Life, he is about 80 & she 50 and he has been candid enough to tell her at the beginning of the Courtship that his only object in geting a Wife was to have his Back kept Warm & his Houes Clean & OEconomically – with sincere good wishes for you all from

your affc Bro
