My dear Will!

I thank you for your letter which gives me the more pleasure for being so written as to flatter me with the continuance of your improvement.

James is so much better that I think he will soon join you. I showed him your letter. Mr Bold extracted the broken needle from Ann's arm. She is well.

You mother joines me in lover & best wishes to you & Matthew.

yrs affectionately

James Maury
