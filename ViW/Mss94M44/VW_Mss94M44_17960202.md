My dear Friend

A Division of Mr Armisteads Estt has at last taken place enclosed you have a list of the people and amount, tho your Brother Fontaine has it in his power to be more particular with you - the indisposition of your Sister Lewis and also my Brother (after I had fix'd the time with Gen'l Mason for a Meeting) prevented my attending. My Brother (poor fellow) died on the sixth & the division took place on the 7th of Jany. Your sister is much better and can now walk about the House.   Our Brother F undertook this business and has executed it - Miss B Armistead has detain'd a Family of four a woman by the name of Gilley and 3 children, and says she must have them, either by exchange, or purchase, in this I am not so well [pleased] as your Brother before they began dividing requested the Family (beginning with Mrs. Armistead) that if they had any Favorites to select them out, they all did so, some had more and some less. Miss B had five or seven, I do not remember which, and not withstanding this business was all fixed, and done with (as Mr FM Supposed) & a man employ'd to take charge of the people & a waggon for conveying, they were detained near ten days on expences thro Miss B's whims and last concluded to keep her. Genl Mason in this time had set out to Congress, otherwise perhaps matters wou'd have been better managed as Mrs Mason had given Miss B a reproof for some [illegible] gave Herself in this business. Mrs Armistead has wrote me, wishing to have a Family sent back, a woman by the name of Corinna & 3 children, that she would be glad to purchase her, or exchange for her, the latter would perhaps best suit the Old Ladys Finances, and altho I really think it whimsical shall try to gratify here, if it can be done conveniently. Miss B is supposed to be at the bottom of this as it is said she dicatates and rules the good Old Lady altogether. Mr F M sold Genl Mason four To Wit - Letitia and Child @ L80 - Mack @ L60, & Jack @ L20 - the remainder I have disposed of to your Brother Fontaine at the Prices they were valued at on the division, to be paid by a Draught on the Alexandria Bank with some little indulgence, this business is not completely carried into effect, so as for me to report particularly to you, and as I understand that Capt Daingerfield is to sail in a few days have thought proper to give you the outline for this business - I have seen the Negroes, talked with them, and appear so desirous of his purchasing of them in consequence I thought it best to contract with him - had I taken some time, and parcel'd them out, I think more could been made, but to make them happy (if possible) I know is much yr wish - the prices may be term'd saving, but not high by any means - when this business if finish'd which will be in [words illegible] fully inform'd Genl Mason had the offer of all the slaves, but declined purchasing only the four above mention'd for the amount has have given a Draught on the Alexandria Bank. With respect to the settlement of the Administration a/c he writes shall take place with the Court of Louisa as soon as possible but from a sketch of this business which Mr FM has Collected I do not like the Complete, however in this (and as I have before observed) and other matters relative to this business Mr FM will I suppose be more particular than I can - I have been but a few hours in his company since his return for poor fellow in his absence he lost a Lovely Babe about four months old in a fir which he never heard of till he got in his own House, he has been up within [illegible] and I accompanied to his Plantation were I saw yr People it was my intention to have gone down yesterday but I have a disagreeable head ake and the weather being very cold have not done so.

You talk of making compensation, you see my friend I have done nothing for you as yet that requires it, yr Brother F has had all the trouble, and a very disagreeable business it was to him I am certain, for you know how he stands with those [text loss]

I shall say nothing to you at present about our [text loss] Sister Strachan has said a good deal I presume, she writes fast & well, has a good Head, and I may very Justly add Heart. 

Your sister Lewis cannot say anything to you at present, as her Eyes are very weak, but observes she is as thankful for yr attention as a Sister can be and begs to be mentioned to you & her Nephew James affecy. name me to James if you please

I am, as I always have been yr affc friend
