Castle St 30 April 1810

Dear Sir

Mrs Maury requested me to put down in writing my sentiments relative to her late fathers concerns which I shall now do & if I am not [wrist] in addressing myself to you I must request you to hand over the letter to any who are interested in the subject.

I understand he did not make a will & that no one has yet administered - that there is a house in Houghton street which was his property and that there is an unsettled amount with Mr Backhouse relative to their partnership concerns & that it is not known whether there be a balance in favor of or against Mr Rutsons estate on that amount and that it is the wish of Mr Rutsons children that all these affairs should be settled and in this I think they are perfectly correct & that they should not delay any measure which is necessary for effecting that purpose and for the following reason - the daughters of Mr Rutson are now receiving the rent of the house in Houghton street and dividing it - now if there be a balace due to Mr Backhouse he or his representatives in case of his death may obtain letters of Admin to the late Mr Rutsons effects as principal Credrs [&] may obtain possession of the house and call on the ladies or their husbands to refund the moneys they have received for rents and thus get possession of all the funds & if the accounts be not made out and produced by Mr Backhouse (I mean the partnership amounts) a bill in Chancery wod be necessary to compel the delivery of them & that at the individual expense of the party applying unless the Chance shod [immediately] order otherwise 

But before I recommend the measures I think it advisable to pursue I must premise that the taking out letters of administration *does not subject the Administrator to the payment of the debts of the Intestate further than the effects which shall come to the hands of the Admin* will extend (unless he misapplies them)

I should therefore advise that one of the children should take out letters of Admin immediately - shod sell the house by answer and give Mr Backhouse notice in form to produce his accounts - if this was refused or declined either one or the other of the following modes might be adopted - viz - to give him a second notice which should have reference to the first and should again call upon him to produce his accounts by a certain day & that if he did not do so the Admer would [conclude] that nothing was due and divide the money amongst the next of Kin & there can be no doubt but that such notice with an Adv in the Gazette calling on the Crs to render an account of their demands would [preclude] any claims from Mr Backhouse or his representatives. The other mode would be to call on Mr B for the production of his accounts & if he refused to file a short bill in Chancry to compel him to do so in which case there is no doubt but he would have to pay the costs - and in either the one or the other mode there can be no doubts that the *worst event that could happen* would be to pay the money the Admnr had recd to Mr B if he proved a bill due to him - And this could only be the Case if on the notice being given Mr B should produce his accounts and they shod show a balance in his favor. 

If Mr Rutson (who I think is the most proper person) will administer and authorize me to act for him I will save him any trouble - this however is to be arranged amongst the parties interested - but unless some one does it the affairs will be left in that state which is hardly justifiable.

Yrs very truly

Jos Lauer
