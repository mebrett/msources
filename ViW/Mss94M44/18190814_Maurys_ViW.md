Liverpool August 14th 181[9]

My dear Brother

As my Mother was going to write to you I took this oportunity of wishing you many happy returns of the day. Master Anne is coming from Sedgwick on Monday next. The goats went on Wednesday to Savannah, they are given to Colonel Harden, from that town, who was at Liverpool about six weeks ago. When John took them down to the vessel, he told the sailors that Nanny was a *Lascar*. This Colonel Harden was particularly introduced to my Father by the President. 

I remain

Your affectionate Brother

Ruston Maury

My dear James!  
I am indeed much concerned to inform you that RH Dowson has conducted himself so improperly that I have been nuder the necessity of dismissing him without any previous notice. I hope you have not lent him any money.

From the date my dearest James will perceive that I have not much time. however, I cannot allow the anniversary of that day (which afforded me so much delight) to pass by without noticing the object which occasioned it. I do indeed wish you every comfort & happiness which this world can give & that you my dear *first born* may not lose sight of a perparation for a better - I hope Dr James has at last hit upon the best plan, and that your foot my perform its part as well as the other, what a comfort that will be!
