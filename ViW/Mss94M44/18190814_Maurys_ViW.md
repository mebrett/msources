Liverpool August 14th 181[9]

My dear Brother

As my Mother was going to write to you I took this oportunity of wishing you many happy returns of the day. Master Anne is coming from Sedgwick on Monday next. The goats went on Wednesday to Savannah, they are given to Colonel Harden, from that town, who was at Liverpool about six weeks ago. When John took them down to the vessel, he told the sailors that Nanny was a *Lascar*. This Colonel Harden was particularly introduced to my Father by the President. 

I remain

Your affectionate Brother

Ruston Maury

My dear James!  
I am indeed much concerned to inform you that RH Dowson has conducted himself so improperly that I have been nuder the necessity of dismissing him without any previous notice. I hope you have not lent him any money.

From the date my dearest James will perceive that I have not much time. however, I cannot allow the anniversary of that day (which afforded me so much delight) to pass by without noticing the object which occasioned it. I do indeed wish you every comfort & happiness which this world can give & that you my dear *first born* may not lose sight of a perparation for a better - I hope Dr James has at last hit upon the best plan, and that your foot my perform its part as well as the other, what a comfort that will be! perhaps it is too much to expect - Your Father was at the funeral of a young Gentl from Savannah last Monday, he had only been one week here, his death was caused by extreme [costineness] on the Voyage & whatever they said he wou'd not take medicine, the mortification had taken place before he landed - he appear'd in good health when he met his former acquaintance & in hood spirits but in two days he was dead! he was 18 years old, six feet high, & a fine healthy fellow when he left home - his Father is attorney general of Georgia & his Grandfather Sir George [Hewson] he was staying at Mrs Storrs in Maryland St a splendid funeral young Gentl Americans supported the pall and about 10 or more attended as did Mr Maury with white silk hatbands scarves and gloves - poor fellow! how greivous it must be to his parents - take warning James & if your bowels are not in a good way - get some Epsom Salts one oz to a quart of Water & take a glass before breakfast - I saw Miss Tomlins but she declined staying with me- Write soon & tell me how you go on - Thank Miss Hey for her lrt which I received with yrs - My love to them all & believe me always yr tenderly affectionate Mother
