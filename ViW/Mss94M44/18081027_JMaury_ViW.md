My dear Sister!

Having already written to our sisters on the loss we all have sustained in that excellent & amiable brother, leaves me the less to say to you on so painful a subject. Let us, while we live hold him in dear remembrance & endeavor to live as he has lived.

I was greatly pleased to find Nancy & Matilda were to take up their abode with you. It will be an acquisition to yourself & to them, must be a comfortable home. I regret it’s not being in my power to do more for them than I have done.

Altho I have not had a letter from you for a considerable time, yet I do not, by any means, feel neglected, nor indeed do I expect this, until your health & spirits shall be stronger & better, which I hope for.

No doubt Lieutenant Lewis will have mentioned our meeting in London. One inducement indeed for my going up at that time really was to see him & while I was on the way – without knowing any thing of it, he had as I found afterwards, most politely apprized me of his being in the metropolis. I regretted very much that I could not have more of his company than his short stay admitted, for independent of the partiality for the son of an old friend, I must have been greatly pleased with him.

In a late letter to Mrs Strachan I mentioned my son Matthew’s indisposition & how I was alarmed. I now consider him perfectly restored.

I am just returned from my annual autumnal excursion to Buxton, to which place we took the boy, in order to give him the chance of benefit from the change of air. It had the best effect & he is gone back to join his comrades at School. I also experienced more than usual good from this out. Your sister also was much the better from it, as, indeed, she generally is.

Altho I hold in great reverance the rules and maxims of our excellent father, yet I have lately deviated from one of them. He never would give any of his sons an horse until we were of age or nearly so. I always thought & do think, he was right. Nevertheless I have just purchased a little Shetland poney (tho’ only indeed about the height of a common sized calf) for the purpose of affording my little fellows the opportunity of learning to ride. Pray ask Nancy if she considers me correct in doing this. I request you to remember me to my old friend Mr Joseph Herndon. Mrs H. I think you told me was dead.

Your sister joins me in affectionate wishes to you all.

Yrs affy

James Maury
