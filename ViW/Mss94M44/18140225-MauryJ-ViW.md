My dear Son

Yesterday evening I was entertaining myself with your Bibliot√©que portative & entered on the account of the celebrated literary character France produced in the two last centuries. I was struck with the longevity of this class of man; as indeed I frequently have been - especially in ~~frequent~~ conversations with your Uncle Bold on the subject, but never met with so strong a case as that before me. The total number of learned men enumerated is 146 including Cardinal Maury, who is living (as we suppose) the dead then are 145: of these there are 42 whose ages are not mentioned. This leaves 103; whose age, as mentioned of which 59 have reached 70 years and upwards!

Shew this to your Uncle Bold on Sunday, when he dines with us. Give my love to Will & tell him I hope to have the pleasure of a line from him before long.

Perhaps I may not write to your Mother today. Tell her I have not even yet commenced the *translation* - My long walks leave me almost as little time here as when at Buxton.

I was yesterday obliged to borrow an Umbrella of my hostels & therefore I think you may as well send me by Capt Bolton the one I keep at the office. Tie it up securely & address it.

yr affectionately

J. Maury

P.[S].O.

Tell you Mother I recommend by all means that she resume the fire in her bedroom. The Cold appears to me nearly equal to what it was last month! 

There is a table for the sailing of the packet Boats in my paper case on my desk in the Office. Pray send it me. 

5m part 2 - dined long ago after having walked down to the Bridge beyond Sir Richard's & returned along the margin of the Canal. As yet I have seen no ~~Bidg~~ Bridges expect those over the Canal.
