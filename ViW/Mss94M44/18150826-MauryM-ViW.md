My dear James

Another ten days is gone! & still no letter why will you so neglect the attention due to us? your Father is greatly disturbed by it - Mr Maxwell kindly wrote to Mr Maury from New York, giving his reasons for quiting the Lancaster and also to inform us he had made an arrangement with Mr Page to take you on to Virginia, how fortunate this occurrence of Mr P being at New York & also Mr Maxwell seeing him. We are truly thankful for this happy coincidence of circumstances and glad that Mr Maxwell avail'd of them - I wrote to you upon your Birth-day but I am sure I cannot tell by what ship your Father sent the letter, however 'tis gone- This I intend to send by either Mr. Brokenbrough or Brook Gwathmey, they, with a Mr Edmund Taylor, & some others are going in the Philip-Tab Captain Tab to Richmond & expect to sail today - A Mr Pederson Envoy from Denmark to America dined here last Wednesday, he had taken his passage in the General Hamilton, when Mr Maury wen tot his office yester morng Mr P had received a notificaiton from his Capt, that he must be on board in an hour he had something to do relative to his clearing at the Custom House, as an acknowledged Ambassador - this being done and the Gent who should have accompanied him to the ship appearing in time, your Father sent Mr Charley - the ship was gone too far to be overtaken Mr Peederson lost his passage and poor Charley returned at 3 oclock with a Face as colourless as his shirt, owing to his having been very sea-sick - and this reminds me to notice, how you have kept your Brothers  and Sister's curiosity on the rack to know whether you were sick & how long?

You must likewise inform us whether the Quadrant afforded you instructions or amusement - I cannot make you comprehend, I fear, how anxious we are to learn all, and everything from your own pen James --

When 12 struck I left off supposing the Philip Tab wou'd not go, it is now 4 & Brook Gwathmey has just been to take leave & say, he goes on board at 6 I have but little time as we have to dine and this must be at the office at 1/2 past 5 - Matt is to go into his Fathers Office next week to be bound the 31st as Wm was - at present he is at Allerton Lodge but order'd home by his Father on Monday to get all things arranged - your Garden does flourish amazingly the root of Rheubarb looks both large & fine - the Pears on your Tree as Wm calls it, are fine, I never saw them larger  I think the Garden altogether has been more fruitful then for 15 years back - Ann & Rutson are gone to School - when you return, you must bring Ann some music, we wish to have General Washingtons March - Mr Jeffersons March - and Hail Columbia we cannot procure the above, even in London where we have tried - Matt sleeps in your Bed & as I promised, I have lock'd up all your things left here. We often suppose what you may be doing & your Brothers compaure their watches with the difference in time, & say "now perhaps Jim is doing so & so" as you are fond of Fruit you will no doubt regale yourself with abundance America affords - Remember me most kindly to all your friends & relatives and pray do write & often, & tell us how you are, where you have been, & what you intend to do? Yr Father is eating his beef-steak whilst I finish this - he smiles with me in Love and kind wishes & in the wish of hearing from you soon he joins your truly affecate Mother
