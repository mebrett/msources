Dear Sir

I take the liberty to send you herewith a letter with its enclosure which I have lately received from the Custom House Officers of Newyork and shall be much obliged to you to endeavour to ascertain whether the vessels alluded to by these officers are the bon√¢ fide property of the ostensible owner Mr Woodham and if not so, whether Messers Anders & Child or any other foreigner, are owners in whole or in part of the said vessels or any of them. 

Referring to your prudence the mode in which you will pursue this Enquiry, I remain

with much Esteen

yr ob sr

What really may be the state of the case, I cannot presume to say - there are Suspicions ~~but~~ I believe as well here as at Newyork, but I ~~really~~ know of no means of coming at the Truth, which I ~~do sincerely regret~~ the more regret as it would give me  ~~great~~ sincerest pleasure to see ~~the~~ such disagreeable things exposed & those concerned in these subjected to the penalties of the Law. I ~~therefore~~ return you the papers here inclosed, assuring you that if any thing shoudl transpire I will, without delay, communicate it. With regular Esteem & respect I here [scribble]
