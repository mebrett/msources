My dear Sir

I set out Tomorrow Morning for Brighton where I intent to remain a short time and then to proceed to Portsmouth to embark in the Essex for America - It is possible however that I may come to London for a day or two before my Departure.

It is proper for me to mention to you (for your own Information) that I shall leave [Mr] John Spears Smith chargd with the affairs of the American Legation here - He is not yet arraived from France; but I expect him soon. In the meantime Mr Lyman will at my Desire correspond with the [alio] office. The other Business of the LEgation will be conducted by myself while I stay. You may address to me to the Care of M Lyssar Birches Lane if you shd have occasion to write. I do not know that I shall trouble you again. I beg you therefore to suffer me now to offer you my friendly adieus & to assure you of the Satisfaction which your official Conduct has always afforded me and of my sincere personal Respect and Regard.
