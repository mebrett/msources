Dear Sister

I have long thought of writing to you but for some reason or other I have put it off, however forgetting all the past, I shall describe the Easter hunt to you as well as I can which I followed a ~~little~~ small way, but should have gone through if I could have got anybody to come with me. At 11 O'clock we went to the Roe Buck were there were a great number of persons assembled, at about half past one there were such a crowd of men, women, horses, and carriages as I never saw before, I think that if there was one thousand there was twenty thousand; at a quarter to two we saw the cart (which was like a wild beast cart) coming with the Stag in; It want slowly down to the Rein deer (an inn so called) I followed it and got into a very good situation; at 2 Oclock the door of the cart was opened, and out leaped the Stag; It took a circuit three or four times round all the people, a few minutes after the hounds came it then ran into the forest and I did not see any more of it, the Cockneighs made such a noise that the Stag escaped. if I had followed I might have seen horses flying without their riders in every direction One man was galloping through the forest and there was a dead branch very sharp on one of the trees which he ran against, the branch entered his ear and blew out his brains. During the chase the hounds drove a flock of deer out of the forest two of which they chased very much at last the deer were so angry that they leaped on a man and knocked him down. I hope that as this is the first letter you will not neglect to answer it. We had holidays from Good Friday to Tuesday. Excuse this sort letter. Give my love to all at home.

I remain
