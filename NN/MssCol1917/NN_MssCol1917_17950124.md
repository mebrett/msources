F.M.

It is my post particular [request] that you forbear drawing on me, be it on what account it may, except you have the right either by my express permission or from my being actually in yr debt. I have it much at heart that our a/c be once adjusted & mutually agreed each perfectly [arbited] truly & bona fide - and therefore if you have any objections the smallest or most[latent] against my statements, I request you as my Bror & [beloved] friend to declare them in the most unequivocal manner, in order that I may have the oppy of [moaing] or yeilding to them.

Notwithstanding it was my own proposal to you to have a joint concern in the St. Tamany & altho I am perfectly satisfied with the Dispatch you have given her, yet a desire to withdraw from all [cooperatives] makes me wish an end of this; in Consequence I offer you for your third of this Vessell as she sailed last Summer from Virginia thirteen hundred pounds sterlg; you [subject] to me for the abatements if any you should receive (as alluded to in a former letter) from the Bills of Cost. If you accept or not, give me your determination as soon as possible. If you should choose to have a Vessell of your own in the trade (which I would particularly recommend & that she be solely yours) you shall find the same attention to her interest, if not to me, as if she'd been part owner were you on the *spot* & wished my two thirds, I would take a lower price than I offer
