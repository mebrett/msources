Mr James Lewis

Spotsylvania Virginia

Mr dr friend!

I take the Liberty to inclose you a power to represent me in the Division of Mr Armisteads Estate, to which I pray your attention. It is my wish that my part of the people be accommodated in whatever can be reasonable de done to make them contented. Mr Mason has written to me on the subject requesting I would authorize some one for their purpose.

This I know must be attended with some Trouble to your self, For which I certainly shall compensate you some way or other because the Labour is always worth of his [time]. I wish no steps to be taken that may be disagreeable to my Mother-in-Law

I give my Love to you & my sisters & am friend &c

your aff Brother

J.M

Informed Mr Mason about a month ago that I had impowered you to act for me
