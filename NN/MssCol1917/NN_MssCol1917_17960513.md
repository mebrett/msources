Hond Madam!

pr George

I had the pleasure of writing to you a few days ago by the Molly bound for Philadelphia, as you were anxious for the earliest answer on the subject of the Family you wished to have, this merely serves to inform you that, by the same opportunity, I desired my good friend Mr. James Lewis and now repeat the request, to have you accomodated in the way most agreeable to yourself. 

Presenting my affc remembrance to the Family. I am truly your friend & affc Son in Law

James Maury
