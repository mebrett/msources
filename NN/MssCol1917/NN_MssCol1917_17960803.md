Honored Madam

My last ltr was of 8th May, since which I remain without any Intelligence from your Neighborhood, but hope for that pleasure soon.

The [very warm] Interest you have [arightly] taken in what concerns me, ever has been truly gratifying & would be but illy requited by withholding from you any communication of this nature. Your son-in-law is, within a few days, to be once more a married Man. The lady a Miss Margaret Rutson, whose family connexions & intercourse with mine, I believe, you are acquainted with. I hope, Madam, I need be at no great pains to persuade you that, at the same time I take a second wife, I retain undiminished the truest Love & Esteem for the Memory of that excellent woman you gave me & must retain those Sentiments as long as I shall possess the Faculty of knowing what is estimable & good & lovely! Adding that so far from deeming it in any way disrespectful I think, in this *second* Marriage, I bear the sincerest Testimony to the Merits of *her* who made me so happy in the *past*!

I present my affc Remembrances to Bob & Betsy. I am yr afc & dutiful Son In Law

J.M.

Mrs. Mary Armistead

Loudon County
