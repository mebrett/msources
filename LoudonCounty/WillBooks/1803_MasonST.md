(p58)

I Stephens Thomson Mason of Loudon County and Commonwealth of Virginia being of sound and disposing mind and memory but in bad Health for the recovery of which I about to make a long Journey reflecting that it is ordained for all me to die and being uncertain how soon or how suddenly I may be summoned from this world deem it necessary to make and ordain this my last Will and testament hereby revoking all others by me heretofore made. My Soul being entirely at the disposal of the Almighty author of it I conceive it to be no fit subject of this my Will and my body when deprived of it will be of so little consequence as to give me no present solicitude about it.

As to my religious opinions I see no necessity of giving an account of them here and whatever they are or may be is of no importance to the World or to those who after my decease my enjoy my Estate which I dispose of in manner following, Viz:

Imprimis, I given and bequeath unto my beloved Wife Mary Mason for and during her natural life all that part of the land on which I now live included within the following boundaries to wit Beginnning at the corner of the fence on the main Road being the South Easterly corner of the farm meadow then to the Northardly post of the New Gate on the Hill above the house that Benjamin Jackson lives in thence to a white oak on the old Road marked TA, being the second corner of Joseph Dixon's Patent thence to where the spring branch in Castles feild [sic] empties into the Run thence up the Run and the large Ditch cut through the old Meadow and continuing the last course of that Ditch till it shall strike the line between my land and my brother John Thomson Mason's land thence with that line to the land lately the property of Colo Burges Ball deceased thence with the lines of that land separating it from mine to a red oak corner on the main road thence along the main road with my lines to the beginning of the said quantity of land more or less my said wife is also to have during her widowhood the priviledge of getting off the land I purchased of the Mercers and of James Ball any timber wood or stone she may have occasion for to support the land herein devised to her it is also my Will and desire that the House now building on the Hill shall be completed and finished at the expence of my Estate and at the like expence such Wings and additions offices inclosures and other conveniences and improvements be made as may suit with the stile of the pricipal [text loss]

[land to John thomson Mason]

Item I give and bequeath unto Mrs Fanny Ellzey the wife of Colo William Ellzey his choice of Winney's two daughterrs Fanny and Eve.

Item I give and bequeath unto Ann the wife of Thomas Hurst and her heirs the Negro Girl Silvia and the boy Talbott now in the possession of the said Thomas Hurst. Also I give and bequeath unto the said Ann, and her Heirs forever one equal moiety of a tract of land on the waters of Scioto in the state of Ohio containing one thousand Acres for which a survey in my name or assigned to me is now lying in the office of the secretary of State at the City of Washington and on which a patent has probably Issues. I also direct that there shall be paid to each of the children of the said Ann which she has or may have one hundred dollars out of my Estate as such children shall respectively arrive at the age of Twenty one years or marry and the like sent to the said Ann should she become a widow.

Item I give and bequeath the residue of my Estate both real and personal wheresoever it may be or in whatsoever it may consist to my beloved wife Mary Mason and my dear brother John Thompson Mason and their Heirs and the Heirs of the survivor of them in trust for the following uses Vis. All the said Estate is hereby made chargeable with the sum of ten thousand dollars to be  paid to my brother John Thomson Mason which I believe is rather less than I at present owe him on account of his claim upon our Fathers Estate and liberal sums he has at different times advanced me any payments hereafter made to him to be deducted from that sum. Also for the support and maintenance of the family I may leave the payments of my Debts and Legacies and the education and advancement of my children hereby giving to my said Trustees or the survivor of them full power and authority to sell any part of my Estate devised in trust as aforesaid and to invest any part of the proceeds thereof as well as the profits of such part of my Estate as may remain in the hands of my said trustees or the survivor of them either in the improvement of my state or int eh purchase of any other property for the use and benefit of my children and to provide for and portion out of my Estate all or any of my children (whether living at the time of my decease or born afterwards) in such time and manner as my said trustees or the survivor may think reasonable or proper hereby delegating to  my said Trustees and the survivor of them all the power in that Respect which I could myself (if living) exercise over the said property in the fullest confidence that my children will find my loss supplied in a Parental care an attention from those to whom I have entrusted them and their property.

I appoint my said brother John Thomson mason Guardian of my sons and my wife Guardian of my daughters having no doubt but that a proper attention will be paid to their Education I think it only necessary to declare it to be my Will and desire that no proper Expense may be spared even to the full extent of my property (if necessary) to render them good and useful members of society according to their respective capacities. But it is my Will that if my Wife should marry again the trust Estate as well as the Guardianship of my Daughters herein devised and delegated to her shall from thenceforth as to my said wife cease and determine and devolve solely and entirely upon my said Brother John Thompson Mason. This precaution does not at all proceed from any distrust or want of confidence in my beloved wife who has always given abundant proff that she is entitled to all that I could repose in her nor from wish to restrain her from a second marriage should she conceive it conducive to her happiness but her own good sense and reflection will point out the prudence and propriety of guarding against the possibility of commiting our Children or their fortunes to the power of a stranger.

Item It is my will and desire that my slaves and stocks (except such as it may be deemed Necessary or advisable to sell) be kept on my Lands in Loudon and my Farm continue to be worked and carried on untill my Trustees shall judge and determine that it would be most beneficial to depart from the said plan in whole or in part. 

Lastly I constitute and appoint my said Brother John Thomson Mason Executor of this my last Will and testament and my sons Armistead Thomson Mason John Thomson Mason Hr. and Stephens Thomson Mason Jr as they shall respectively attain the age of twenty one years to be joined with my said Borther in the said Executorship.

In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand & affixed my seal this twenty second day of April in the Year of our Lord on thousand eight hundred and three.
