Dear Sir

I have to acknowledge the receipt of your kind favor of 26th instant and have to return you my best thanks for your remittance of Â£5..0..0

It is astonishing to me that mine was the first intimation you had of my Late Dear Brothers death As it was mentioned in the list of Killed & Wounded in the Gazette I wrote on December last to the Rt Hble George Rose and received from him a very Polite letter p return of Post testifying his Inability at that time of rendering me and Service Now the late change in the Ministry has reinstated him in Office and I have only to lament I have no friend who could write to him in my favor not doubting but the time would now be favorable. I lament the state of trade being so dull at present but I have no doubt in the least you will remember me as soon as opportunity offers. My mother begs her kindest remembrance. In the mean time believe me most truly Dear sir

your obliged hble sert
