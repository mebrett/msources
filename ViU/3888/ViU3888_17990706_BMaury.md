Dr Brother,

I wrote you sometime ago requesting your Assistance in the Purchase of a piece land, should you be in a situation to do so, tis a matter I very much wish to accomplish, but have not sufficient means to undertake it alone. Fontaine has promised to do something in the business, and I doubt not his [compliance] tho he complains of being hard push'd at present, you will much oblige me by a Letter, so soon as a conveyance can be had as I am obliged to move from the [*text loss*] I now live on (this fall) and shall be at a loss [*text loss*] a home, unless I can buy one - I have acquir[*text loss*] gout in one of my feet, which has been very troublesome for some time past, and still is, I have often heard that poor people ~~were~~ never had such a complaint, but I am convinced to the contrary, however could I be persuaded I should ever be rich, perhaps the pains might be borne with a little more fortitude. Betsy the little tribe and myself unite in good wishes for you and yours. 

I am Your Affc Brother
