My dear Sir

I duly received your obliging favor with the inclosed letter from my God Daughter Mrs Lacey. I beg you will accept my best thanks for your Letter & kind attention in forwarding hes, it is a very long time since I have heard from any of that family. Mrs L letter is full & descriptive of their present situation I am particularly happy to hear she was well Married & comfortably settled before the death of her Mother.

Permit me to congratulate you & Mrs. Maury on the pleasing addition of a Daughter to your family. I wish one of your Boys was old enough to come & pay his addresses to my Niece. I should like very much to keep up a little American Blood in my family - & to see her well settled, as I begin to feel my self growing old, tho I am thankful to say I enjoy very good health & spirits, we have been settled in Harley St in a charming good House rather more than two Years, where Mr Pearkes & myself will be very happy to see you should you visit the Metropolis. my Father had a very severe illness last Winter, which confined him to his Bed & Room for more than three months, & I believe none of the Medical People thought he could recover. the dooness of his Constitution & great temperance, carried him through & he now enjoys better health than most Men of his age.  
Mr Pearkes & Maria beg to unite with me in best regards to you Mrs Maury & family. I am much pleased with my Cousin Dr Massie who appears a sensible steady young Man, I am dear Sir

Your Affectionate Humble St

M Pearkes

I did myself the pleasure of writing to Overton yesterday. MP
