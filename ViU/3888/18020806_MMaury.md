My dear Brother

yr Letter of the 4th Feb came to hand some Time in May. It is always pleasing to me to hear from you; but in the present Instance was particularly so, as it had been so long since I had had that Pleasure, owing to a suspension of our Correspondence, which on my Part I can make no other Apology for than ~~the~~ an  uninterrupted series of bad health for about three years past. 

I thank you for your kind & affectionate Attention expressed in your Letter for my Recovery of a better State of Health. I had before the Receipt of ~~your Letter~~ it made us of most, if not all, of the medicine prescribed by Doctor Brandreth, tho not prepared in the same Manner. Since which I have made use of the Preparations prescribed by him, but without experience any permanent Benefit, which has indeed been the [case] of every thing I have ever taken. This with some other Circumstances induces me to suspect that those of the Faculty I have consulted - Namely Bagnham, Minor, Worth & Meriwether, are mistaken as to the seat & nature of my complaint.
