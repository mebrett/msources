Whitehaven 30th August 1796

My dear Sir

I am extreamly happy indeed my worth friend to see you announced in Master Goos as having been at Hymens altar with Miss Rutson. I assure you none of your friends will be better pleased at every Felicity attending that Estate being attach'd to my Countryman the American Consal than my self - please make my congratulations to yr fair one and I sincerely wish her & your days may be long & Happy

I have sent to Flour to the different Ladies where C. Yates directed, it to be sent to to, and have open'd ans. I think the coming in a tobacco ship has hurt it a little I thought Yates had been better informed than to [said] flour with tobacco, except it had been first rolled into the water.

When I wrote you the ship in Mathews letter I had not the least knowledge of your soon intending to become a _Benedict_ I was only wanting to spur you on to Felicity.

Make my Respects to Mrs. Maury and accept my best wishes for every good to attend you in whc my cara spousa heartily unites. 


I am Dear Sir always your friend

Samuel Martin

PS James my lad this hot weather keeps a [honey] in hand
