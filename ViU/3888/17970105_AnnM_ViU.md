Janry 5th 1797

You know not, my dearest Bro how much I am delighted to hear you have change'd your lonely situation to one which I trust will add greatly to your happiness_ and I shou'd be still more so, cou'd I flatter myself you were in earnest when you talk of making us a visit accompanied by my sister for whom, tho' a perfect stranger, I feel that attachment due to the other self of the best of Brothers - who not only anticipates, but supplys the wants of his friends, for my part of which, all the compensation I have to offer is a hear overflowing with gratitude. the Cloak & shawl were very acceptable and were much approv'd off, the spectacles are so much the *thing* that I scarely do any thing without them tho' I have not been long enough accustom'd to wearing them to put them on with so good a grace as I might, but suppose I shall improve -

Our Niece Milly was married the 27th of the last month to a son of our old friend and acquaintance Mr. Henry Frys, a very worthy respectable young man, to whom, no other objection was urg'd but that of his being too nearly connected. They took their departure a few days since for the end-fare attended by our dear Matilda mounted on your bounty - she means to stay about a week to try her luck - and there's no knowing what a clever sprightly girl may do for herself in a strange neighborhood - I expect her back in a day or two, when it is probable she will write and give you some account of her adventures, particularly if she shou'd be successful - the little thing is heartier and looks better than ever I saw her, in short, she is quite fat and saucy.

Our honour'd Parent has been much indispos'd for some time with a disagreeable cold, but is now getting the better of it, she is so declin'd since I wrote you last that we are seldom favor'd with a visit now-a-days, tho' is still quite chearful and likes to chat about old times as well as ever - she desires her love to you and her new daughter and bigs me tell you that she is too old to write now and observes that as you are of full age to chuse for yourself dose not doubt but you have made a prudent choice, and of course she is pleas'd that you have done so - our Br is about writing you a long letter, and as he is a much better scribe than my self will tell you more about himself and family than I can, therefore will refer you to him for particulars - our other Brs & Sisters, I believe, are going on much as usual and they all have as much time to write as I have, imagine they will speak for themselves.

Do send us by the first conveyance a piece of Huckaback and a crate of earthenware (not edg'd) for which the needful shall be sent to our Br Fontaine - all here join in wishing my dear Br and Sr every species of happiness with

your affect

A Maury

PS your old friend Col. Morris was admiring my spectacles the other day, when I enquired if those you sent him suited his age,  *No, consume him, he was courting when he got mine and they are at least 4 years too young* was his reply - this you'll say was the Man himself AM.
