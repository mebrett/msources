Dear Sir

Supposing from you favor of the the 26 which is just come to hand, that you are not acquainted with my Nephew Overtons return to England & his situation being such that it may not be in his power to write you for a day or two, I do myself the pleasure to inform you of his safe arrival in Southampton River on Thursday last, on Friday my Father received a letter from him, requesting he would go to the Duke of Portland Office & answer for his being an American, which he did, from [thenamy] Father was sent to Mr. King who refused to have any thing to say to the business alledging that Mr. O. A. did not apply to him when he went to France & he must return by the same authority he went out, however on a second application my Father has succeeded better & Mr Wickham the Duke of Portlands Secretary has promised that an order shall be sent down this Eveng permitting Overton to land, Mr Scott had renewed his acquaintence with Miss Hewitt the Lady he was on the point of Marriage with before he left this Country, he gives me great uneasiness with best Compliments to Mrs Maury I am Dr Sir

Your Obliged Friend
