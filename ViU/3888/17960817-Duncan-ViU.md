My Dear Sir

Yesterday I delivered your letter to Miss Walke as you desired. 

From the best information I have been able to obtain, it appears that it will not be necessary for you to undergo the fatigue and trouble of formally sitting to receive any visitors, but at the same time it is consistent with that is practiced in the fashionable circles to give notice to your friends on what day or days you wish them to pay their respects. in this case it is not expected that *you* will be at home, but that the Bride receives the visitors in a less formal stile than what was formerly practiced.

Mr Hughes joins me in wishing you every possible happiness.

With much respect I am  
My dear sir  
your obliged Serct

Wm. M Duncan
