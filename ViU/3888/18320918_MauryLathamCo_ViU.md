Dear Matthew

We wrote to you yesterday pr New York stating that the Cotton market Vessel [sum] there is no change to day. the Sales announced to fully 3000 500 of which are on speculation & to use [Jaymans expression] a stiff market. Probably therefor the Trade & the Speculators will enter fuly in the course of the week.

No change in tobacco Mr Orr purchased 2 old & 1 new [Steifs] ch 5d yesterday for Ireland.

You will [now] have the [Came] market [descends]

truly yours
