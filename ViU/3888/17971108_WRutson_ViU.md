Dear Sisters

I am just come from Mrs Maurys where I have been for the first time to see little Junr - he is very well but it is not yet certain whether he has caught the infection. There is some inflammation about the places of incision but not the least degree of fever. The object of this letter is to acquaint you that our Poor little Fellow accepts your invitation to spend the Winter with you - Brandrell & Allan strongly insisted on the Country Air being tried & gave preference to Sedgwick - Mrs A & Mrs M seconded their opinion and [enforce it with] observing the good Company he will be to you - We intend setting out on Sunday Morng if nothing in business prevents me & we bring Miss Nicholson along with us - I can only stay with you one day, having been so long from the office but thank God I am now nearly well again - If we dont get in by 9 oClock on Sunday night dont look for us till morng but I hope to reach sooner than that time. I shall bring the money you want along with me.

Yours most affectionately

W. C. Ruston
