Brodie November 3rd 1802

Many thanks to my Dear good Papa for writing me so often, and being so attentive to me in every thing. Aunt Strachan had just given me some linen, and was about to get more to make out my number, so that Richard and myself can divide what you send if it is necessary. I am much pleased at the present you have sent me for her, for indeed Papa I love her dearly. I am sorry to tell you that Aunt Lewis has not got well yet. Uncle is much better, and Brother Richard is quite well, but has such an appetite that he don't know when to leave off eating, especially now the sweet potatoes are dug; you know they are mighty good. I sent Grandmama, little Albert and Betty a fine roast the other day. Uncle William was here last week, he told us the were all well, and Betty talked a great deal. I am sorry to hear you have not got my letter by Mr Chew, as that would ~~will~~ tell you why I was so long without writing you. I am glad to hear you talk of seeing us this winter for it seems to be more than a year since you were here you don't know my dearest Papa how much I love you, and how often I think of you and wish you lived where I could see you as often as I wish. good by my beloved Papa. I am your dutiful and affectionate daughter

I thank you my dearest Br for your kind attention on all occasions, your letters by Col. Mercer, as well as by post came safe to hand. the sugar & coffee I suppose are arrived also, but we have not yet heard. I expect you counted on a two years stock in those articles, the linen &c, I imagine Col M keeps for some good opportunity; we are informed through him that your prospects are extremely good, which is very gratifying to your friends here. do say something on that score when you write. our anxiety for your wellfare will justify this request. the letters mentioned by Mr Chew [textloss] you have received. he kept it a [text loss] time before it was put in post office, which accounts for its not [textloss] you as early as I expected; when I put it into his hands he expected to set out for New york the next day, since that I understand he is waiting for Mr Hackley's coming on. the invalids before mentions are all about again. little Dick is quite fat poor fellow he has had a narrow escape in the light of his fever he was taken with a fit which lasted an hour when he hardly discovered life, luckily Doctor Carmichael stept in, otherwise the consequences might have proved more serious my good man [J Sr L] are mending but not rapidly this fine weather I hope will be an advantage to them. a letter from our Nancy a few days since tells us our Br has [been] much indisposed for a week past, in short that almost every body has been sick. I never heard of such a sickly year as this has been. I must stop here as company have just stept in, [&] Br Richard is going who is to take this to the office. I have not said half I wish but will do it when I can for this has been a very troublesome week to me with comers & goers in consequence of the [commenceme]

adieu says your Sr M S
