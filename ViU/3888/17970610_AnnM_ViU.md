My Dr Brother

I am greatly pleas'd to find by your letter to our Mother that you enjoy high health, good spirits &c and through another channel I am inform'd that you are quite gay and sprightly which is sufficient to convince me that you have made a happy choice - which is a pleasing reflection to your friends here - 

Mathilda & self are now on a visit on Lewis' River - we left our friends in Albemarle well about a fortnight since and found all here so and uncommonly glad to see us, as it seldom happens that your sisters are all four together - and we are just as well pleas'd with each other as if we were [new things], and enjoy ourselves as much as ever sisters did - Oh! that my dear Brother and Sister cou'd step in and Join our happy circle - I don't know two persons in the world that wou'd meet with such a cordial reception as yourselves for we wish most ardently to see you, tho' can hardly flatter myself that, that wish is ever to be gratified - notwithstanding the visit you mention'd when you wrote me last - which letter I answer'd last January, tho' am afraid you have not receiv'd it yet, as our Bro Fontaine inform'd that it was some time before he cou'd get a conveyance an din case it has miscarried I will repeat the articles I requested you to send his Reverence, to wit, a crate of earthen ware and piece of Huckaback, for which Fontaine shall receive the needful - our sister Strachan begs you'll excuse her silence  by this opportunity as she has lately [written] and joins in wishing you every species of happiness with

your affect sister

A Maury
