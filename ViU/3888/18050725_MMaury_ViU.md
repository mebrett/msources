My dear Brother

This I suspect will be handed to you by Mr. George Watson, the son of my Friend Major James Watson of Lousia, who takes his Passage, I understand, in a vessel of yours & will of course take Liverpool in his way to Edinburg - He being a young Gentleman of Merit & Respectability, I take the Liberty of recommending him to your Notice & Attention.

I wrote you a very long letter some weeks ago, since which nothing material has occured - expect the Death of your old Friend Mr Davis, who left us on Friday last - All here are well - Nancy has a letter on hand but could not get it ready as the Notice of this Opportunity was short. Name me to my Sister & Nephews. 

I am

Yr affectionate Brother

Matthew Maury
