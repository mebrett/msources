Whitehaven 20th August 1796

My dear Sir

I am extreamly happy indeed my worthy friend to see you announced in Master Goose as having been at Hymans altar with Miss Rutson I assure you none of your friends will be better pleased at Every Felicity attending that Estate being attach'd to my Countryman the American Consul than my self - please make my congratulations to yr fair one and I sincerely wish her & your Days may be long & Happy

I have sent the Flour to the different Ladies whom C. Yates directed it to be sent to and have open'd ans I think coming in a tobacco ship has hurt it a little I thought Yates had been better informed than to send flour with tobacco, except it had been first rolled into the Water. 

When I wrote you the Shop in Matthews letter I had not the least knowledge of your soon intending to become a *Benedict* I was only wanting to spur on you to felicity.

Make my Respects to Mrs Maury and accept my best wishes for every good to attend you in whc my Cara Spousa heartily unites.

I am Dear Sir always

Your Friend 

Saml Martin

PS James my lad this is hot weather keep a [houss] in hand
