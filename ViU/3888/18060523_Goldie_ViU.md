Sir

Altho' I have not the pleasure of being personally acquainted with you - yet long before I had any views of placing my Son at Liverpool, your Character was not unknown to me; when my Son first pointed to the mercantile line, my earnest wish was, that he might be placed under your Care, in this I have been gratified, and the very handsome manner in which you agreed to take him into your employ (which my good friend Mr. Corrie inform'd me of) can never be too gratefully valued by my son and self. and your kind indulgence in allowing his apprenticeship to commence the first of Janr last, also greatly enhances the obligation confered on us & I sincerely hope his conduct will be such as to prove he is not undeserving of the kindness you have bestow'd that this may be so, is the sincere prayer of an anxious mother. I am

Sir

with great Respect & Esteem  
Your oblig'd Obt Humble Servt

Me: Goldie
