My Dear Brother

(Triplicate)

A few days ago I returned from the Division of our Fathers Estate, on which occassion every Legatee except yourself attended - the whole of the personal Estate was divided, the Parson compensated for the use of the Glebe during our mothers residence there, and his account as Executor Finally settled, all which I am gratified in saying, was done to the Content of all parties interested, as well White as Black - In your absence I undertook to act for you - Memnon at £100, Dick of 67 years old at £5 & Peter a small Boy at £30 was the Lott you drew, which amount to £7.5.6 more than your Portion of the Estate, I debit you that sum paid the other Legatees - Memnon had a Wife at Col Lindsays and wishing to be sold to him, I undertook to take valuation payable the first of June next - old Dick having been a good & Faithful slave & wishing much for a Birth at my Plantation in this County I have accomodated him - as some of Peters connections belong to me and he wishes to remain with them, you may if you chuse debit me valuation for him.

I was really much distressed at the great change which hath taken place in our Mother within these few months, she is quite helpless not being able to move without assistance - she however retains her usual good spirits, but I apprehend from all appearances that she cannot long remain with us.

You herewith have a sketch of the business relating to Mr. Armistead Estate by which you will see that Mr. Mason has not paid one Penny of his negociable Paper at Alexandria Bank, which I have been unwilling to enforce without Special Instructions - he has not come forward for the adjustment of all account as he so pointed promised two years ago - 

I have long since advised you of the sale of your Kentucky Land at 700 Dollars Five Hundred of which have been received and the balance I now daily look for from Ludington - the Balance due from me for the negroes bought of James Lewis and more has been expended in the Education of our Nephew Tom & others agreeable to my letter of the 15th July.

I will now reply to your letter of the 9th August, in doind which I should be highly ungrateful to say, or insinuate, that any part of your Conduct towards me had ever been such as to warrant the neglect wherewith I am charged, which has by no means been so great as you seem to suppose - Many of my Letters must have miscarried, I have therefore lately sent forward Copies of the most important - the one of the 15 July I am more surprised at than any other, on account of the particular channell in which one Copy was certainly placed - with regard to my Bills, I will be candid in saying that I did not expect any of them would have been returned, not because I was absolutely certain there would be ample funds to take them up, but because I had reason to expect there would be little or no difficiency, and indeed, if any Tobacco at Liverpool had turned out as well as what I had sold in London, there would have been none - this, too I had some grounds to Reckon on, as 'twas all shiped about the same time, and almost every hhd of what went to London of Rappahanock Inspection and a great proportion of what went to Liverpool of the Richmond Inspections. In making this remark however I pray you not to mistake my meaning, which is not to doubt in the smallest degree, but that the best sales which the markett would afford were made by  you, not only on this, but on all the occassions wherein I have been similarly situationed.

For my own part I can truly observe that i have on on occassion that I can recollection been unmindfull of your Interest, and on some I may perhaps have been over anxious to promote it, for when I determined on making the shipment in the Neutrality, my first object was to assist in giving the Vessell a freight & dispatch, after having engaged in the business, I promised myself a handsome profit, and really refused 4000 Dollars for my charm I have however been quite too sanguine, & shall thereby suffer extremely, but I have myself only to Blame and must Rub through in the best way I can

Mr Johnston was here about two months ago and asked payment of the £300 which I had more than 12 months before requested you

[Note: UVA file folder lists this as Matthew Maury to James, but the handwriting is not consistent with Matthew's letters. Given the reference to the settlement of Armistead's estate, as well as the business arrangements, this letter is almost certainly from Fontaine.]
