Dear Sisters

I arrived here last Night about Twelve oClock the Mail did not come up to Buxton till late - I got to Preston about 1/2 past 6 and then posted it by myself very unpleasantly in the dark - Mrs R continues pretty well and desires her love to you - I have seen Mrs. Maury - little Jim is better - I also went up to Mrs Nicholsons to acquaint her how I left her Daughter, but Mrs N was gone out. I saw Miss Ellen & the younger Sister who had not then received Miss N's letter.  
my love to my pleasant fellow-traveller and tell her [text loss] may so happen that I may have the satisfaction of returning with her to Liverpool in the Spring. And more unlikely things have happened in this world of Changes. We feel the want of William very much - however it is our duty to give him every opportunity of establishing a good Constitution and in the mean while we must submit to the want of his company. 

Give our love to him and accept the affection regard
of W.C.Rutson
