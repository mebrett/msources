Dear Sir,

Not having heard a syllable from or of either of my Nephews since they left England & being extremely anxious on their account these alarming times, I hope you will excuse the liberty I take in requesting the favor of a line from  you, giving me any information you may have received of them. I have watched the Newspaper & Lloyds list dayly, but have not been so fortunate as to see the arrival of the Columbia at Savanna. Overtons situation if he is still in France must I fear be very unpleasant & perhaps a dangerous one, any intelligence of him, or Frances, will very much relieve my anxious feelings & be gratefully acknowledged. 

I beg my respectful Compliments to Mrs. Maury & sincerely congratulate you both on the addition of a Son & heir to your family, my Father and Maria are in good health, the former desires his best respects to you, Maria is still at School & so very happy that she solicits to continue six Months longer than I intended she should, she is very much grown & improved in all respects, if you have heard lately from our good friends in Loudon I shall esteem it an additional favor if you will inform me how they are & believe me

Dear Sir  
You sincere friend & Obedient Humble Sert

Anderson
