I have neglected writing my Dears uncle some time, owing to the Ill state of health I have been in but thanks to heaven and my Dr uncle Fontaine, I am now much mended though not entirely recovered, my good uncle who has been a second Father to me, hearing of my indisposition, came to visit me, and insisted, on my going to the Green Springs, and eh would discharge my accounts had it not been for this last, and greates of his favours I must most undubitably have long since sunk under my disease I most sincerely congratulate you on your change of situation, and may you long enjoy the happiness resulting from a happy union - it always gives me pleasure to follow the precepts of my superiors, and as example is more prevalent and I think you so good a patron, have some strong inducement to follow your good example. I am induced to apprise you of my intentions from a conviction, that what ever so materially concerns my happiness will afford you pleasure - the person I now have in contemplation is Mr. John Hay, Sone of Mr William Hay of Richmond, whose character I suppose you are acquainted with - I am induced to believe his Sone is no way inferior to him in goodness - [alleast same] has been very lavish in his praise - he has very little fortune, and no profession at present - but I have some expectation so fhis studying they law - in my estimation merit is far preferable to wealth when a person is about to make choice of a companion for life; I think there should be little regard paid to mercinary motives if the partys possess prudence and industry, their will be no fears of their accumilating a plentiful subsitance - and for more I never would wish - if no unforeseen accident should happen to prevent, and my health bee reestablished, I suppose a connection will take place some time hence though the period is very uncertain. I am pleased to find from your letters, that you have some expectations, of visiting us, there are few things on earth that would afford me more pleasure than a personal interview with you . I returned a few days since, from a visit in Albermarl, where I left all friends well - with wishing you and my Aunt a long series of happiness, in which I joined by Mamma and the girls, and our most affectionate love to Cousin James

believe me your ever affectionate niece
