It was with the greatest pleasure, I recd your kind favour acquainting me with your good intention, which is truly laudable, as I know no Gentleman more capable of making a lady truly happy, in a married state, then my good friend, and no one that has enjoyed greater happiness in that line, Mr B unites me, in wishing you every felicity, the matrimonial state can afford, and as this is now the pleasant Season, for Visiting the Lakes, we shall be extremely happy to see you and your intended lady (though unknown to us) and will with pleasure meet you at Keswick, at any time you will acquaint us, of your arrival there - and believe me to be, with sincerity,

Your Friend

Eliza Brumfield
