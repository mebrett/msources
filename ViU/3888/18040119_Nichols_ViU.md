Dear Sir

I should not be at ease with my own mind, were I to leave the Kingdom without returning you & your Lady my sincere Thanks for the polite Attention I have received. 

I had written a letter to you from Liverpool under date 10th ins. but on perusing it I decline forwarding it. it had been hinted to me that I had undortunately I assure you, and I assure you too, unintentionally, incurrd the Displeasure of Mrs Maury it was a [thong] of Injustice for my freedom of manners I beg her forgiveness and I pray to be permitted to make her a tender of my Respects. I pray yourself to consider me in as favorable point [of view] as heretofore and to accept my fervent wishes for your Health & Happiness and prosperity of your growing Little Ones, whom embrace for me. Let me not be forgotten to Miss Bole.

The Rocking of the ship and a beginning sea sickness will be my apology for being incorrect.

Adieu Sir! Adieu!

respectfully yours
