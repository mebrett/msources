Cheltenham 23d April 1814

My dear Matt

Mr Newton having been at the same house with me & telling me the mourning he means to return to Eton I could not let slip so good an opportunity of writing.

The waters of Cheltenham have been very serviceable indeed I may say have been extremely so & I now am so entirely free of any complain that I propose returning the day after tomorrow. I much regret that I could no have more of your company this vacation, but hope it will be otherwise on the next occasion. From what I observe here I am confident these waters would be particularly proper for your mother & I shall endeavor to prevail on her to try them instead of her favorite Buxton. 

I had a letter from her the other day in which she informed me of your attending Mr [Orrc VerVause] &c which pleased me much.

I am now about preparing for my return & have many little matters to attend to your affc father
