Dear Sir

From the Friendship I have formed for you makes me not indifferent to what concerns your Brother, although I never had the pleasure to see him and probably never shall. Great efforts are making to injure his well earned reputation as a public officer, and altho' our Worthy President is not of a Character to abandon a Man on Slight Grounds, yet it may not be amiss for you and your Brother to know of the Efforts that have been made and are still making to injure him - you must be aware how necessary it will be to withhold my name from every person except your Brother on this subject, my situation forbids the disclosure of names. I had the pleasure to sup with your Friends, Mr & Mrs Tayloe last evening who were well. I am truly your Friend

Richard Forrest
