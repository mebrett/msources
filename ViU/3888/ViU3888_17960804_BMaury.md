Brother

Could I write like yourself it would give me a deal satisfaction, but as I cannot, you will be good enough to put up with a short letter, as I never wrote on in my life, that I could say was any ways pleasing, and further never expect to be pleased in that way, as it tis a business I seldom undertake knowing my inability. 

I am much obliged to you for your very Kind and acceptable presents, and will remit as soon as I find the Bag you mention but when that will happen is uncertain. Betsy is under many obligations to you for the handsome gown pattern, together with the Linnen - and as to the Watch, you could not have named such another thing - I fear you have laid me under more Obligations respecting my children, than I can ever make good, unless the bag should be found, however I will embrace one at present (namely) sending your nephew & namesake to [shool] to Mr James Waddell - I mentioned what you desired to our Brother Matthew, who says it will be well to send him where I mention as a day scholar, as he has no vacancy himself as yet, & the Lad is idle. my better helf, with nephews, nieces, & self wish you all the good things this world can afford and better in the next.

Your affc Brother

Benjamin Maury
