Bath 23d March 1807, No 15 James St near Kings Mead Terrace

Dear Sir

You no doubt will be surprised to hear from me but I am Confident from the long friendship which Existed between my Dear Late Worthy Father and yourself and also the knowledge which you have had of me while in Business in Liverpool that you will [Now] My Dear Sir shew yourself my Friend when I open to you my present Situation which I shall no now briefly explain - On my misfortunes taking place in Liverpool three years ago I accepted the invitation of my Dear Late Brother S. E. Busigny and came with my mother to this place where he had Just commenced a Brewery and I was fixed therein as Clerk &c and every thing was going on extremely well when Alas my Poor Brother fell in the action with Lord Nelson off Trafalgar being Captain of Marines on board the Temeraire. You may Judge of my situation when you know that he has left a Widow and three young Children to lament his loss. the Brewery concern is now finally closed and I am now left once more to look out for Bread Mrs B & family having left Bath and now reside at Rumsey, Harts. this being the Case I now look towards my native Town for Support and knowing the American business to be the only one at present prospering I beg leave to offer myself Sir to you as a Clerk or Bookkeeper or if you can recommend me to any of your friends as such I shall take it kind of you In short I flatter myself [f] absence has not deprived me of that Resource which you My Dear Sir have in your lifetime experienced from my late worthy Father viz a Friend in Need. I am thank God perfectly restored to health excepting a Lameness which still continues but on the other hand I have abilities and can bear the Confinement of a Desk much better than many Persons who are in Good health in other respects. I now Conclude and Hope to have the honor of an Answer from You as soon as convenient. I shall be leaving Bath the commencement of April for Liverpool. In the meant time believe me

Dear Sir

Your most humble Servt

Victory Busigny

You recollect no doubt my Uncle Simeon Busigny Seigneure de Chavarne Berne en Suisse - 12 months ago I was informed of his Death & that he had Dyed very rich but Alas here again Ill Luck seems to follow me for notwithstanding the Presumption that he has undoubtedly made my late Brother Simeon & Myself his Heirs yet I am not able to get any further information about him the Communication between that Country and England being Cut off by the war.
