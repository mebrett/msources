My dear Ann

As you supposed, I was indeed surprised at Spouse & Willy's journey & cannot but wish it had taken place when I was on the spot, what a world of scrubbings I cou'd have carried on in their absence! as it is, I can only suggest what is particularly desirable, that the dining-room be dis-robed of its furniture, except your piano, & the sideboard, both of which, shou'd be covered with the sheets which are used to cover the bed-quilts when sweeping rooms, & an old green cloth which lays upon the chair in John's pantry, *mind* you forbid the use of the green floor cloths for the above purpose- when the Carpet is to be cleaned order John previously to rake the grass-plot with the wood-rake & also to sweep it with a beesom. after the Chimney is swept not soon, than ten oclock, because of someone going into the Garden to see the Boy sweep the Top of the Mug they must swep the walls ceiling, & backs of shutters, then wash them well with soap & water (I desired John to tell you he was to get some scouring flannel) & dry them with some of their worn rubbers perviously washd very clean & mangled in an orderly way, for if they are at all greasy the walls with look worse than ever - the last polish may be done by some of Mr Maurys oldest [towels] which you will find in the towel drawer at the front & in the end next my fine place - they may manage with the assistance of John [Bden] about the Curtains the brushing & shaking must be done very carefully on the account of their extreme tenderness - I woud after the above is accomplished - have the best parlour thoroughly cleaned, that is, the chimney swept, the paper cleaned, with a clean flannel pined over the brush the carpet done on the grass, as the diningroom one, the floor also, as well as the former, to be washed with plain *clean* water & when dry, the greasy places to be fullersearthd & scour'd - *see* that they do not fix their soot clouts as is their practice, to the edges of the chimney-pieces with forks & thereby, break the walls, but have weights brought up stairs before the sweeps arrive & then they can clap them on the cloth at once upon the Chimney-piece  -  The oil for the smoak-jack you will find in the far corners of the dresser in the store room tell Betty that it is my desire she watches Motheram put the oil into the Boxes & take away the Bottle when he has taken what is needfull, for I am sure, when not watched he translates the residue to his own stock, & added to this, I have too little for our consumption  -  I think the kitchen Chimney shoud not be done on the day of the parlours because the Boyler will be so necessary to supply the larger quantities of water; & for cleaning the ktichen, the Laundry or servants-hall with afford sufficient - tell Betty to remove every-thing out of the Kitchen for she must take all down, tins &c &c to sweep & clean the walls therefore it is best to do it at first & thereby avoid additional dirt. Betty will of course scour *all* tings, let Johns Candlebank be scourd.

With respect to my room, I wou'd after brushing to the top of Bed, drawer-tops, boxes, &c &c have the floor washed with clean water then fullers-earthed & scour'd next day - whereever the side stones of the hobs of grates are rough the consequence of smoak, tell her to scour them with sand as she woud a [text loss] *Enough!* you say

As to leaving home *now* it is my desire you *do not* before my return - you well know, I never either do, or even wish to debar you of pleasure, but you my dear Anne know, the youthful heedlessness of the oldest of our female domesticks, and that John is not, as he might be, any, the least check upon them, besides that the last importation wants looking after, at Fathers request, I spoke to her the night before I left home in consequence of her paying an Eveng visit at Kitty Bodens without ever asking leave - Margt will take this so adieu - Mrs W is much the same begs her love so do they all with your Affct Mother M Maury
