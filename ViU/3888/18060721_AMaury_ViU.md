My dearest Brother

Notwithstanding your long silence you see I will still persevere in communicating my thoughts to you, and when I tell you this will be giving you to take up your pen of the fate of one of those letters dated Novr 1804 I am particularly anxious to hear, as with it I sent a box containing a small present for my sister & Niece and having no information of its arrival, I fear it is lost - however I will not look on the dark side entirely (as nature too often incline us to do) but rather conjecture that some accident has retarded your letter, and hope it is on the way, and will, e'er long, be brought to light, which wou'd be very [reviving] to your sister, who has not had the scrape of your pen since December 1804. I shou'd also like to know whether the old manuscript (the history of our family I mean) arrive'd sage, how you are going on with the translation, and when there will be a probability of getting a peep at a production I so much wish to peruse as by so doing I may be better acquainted with some worthy ancestors whom nature [teaches] us to love and esteem.

Our good Brothers health has been on the decline for several months, in consequence of which he is much reduced, but I thank God he has been mending for a week past - the rest of the family enjoy better health than we have a right to expect this dry hot weather for there never was such a drought known in our land as we now experience - a calamity very severely felt already - most of the springs & streams being entirely dry, and the others so much on the decline, that we can't get water sufficient for the use of our family, the sock, of course, must suffer immensely, and I find it very inconvenient, being oblige'd to send my Cloths to the old Rock spring (where we have had so many pleasant walks) to be wash'd - but however gloomy the prospect may appear, I will still hope for the best. 

I suppose you have heard before this of the death of our Brother Abram's wife, who is a very great loss to her family, and which the poor fellow very much laments, but time & reflection will I trust e'er long reconcile him to his fate - our Br Fontaine gratify'd us with a visit last spring, after an absence of nearly three years - he is the picture of health, and looks remarkable well for his age - on his return, I accompanied him as far as Lewis's river, where I had the pleasure of finding all our connexions, as well as people generally are at their advance'd period of life - I still enjoy a jaunt of this sort, provided it is not too long, for after an absence of two or three weeks, I feel as great an inclination to get home, as if I had left a houseful of children - this is a proof, that after a little variety, home is the most desirable place to old people like ourselves - on my return from that neighborhood I took Mathilda home with me after a visit of six months, which, tho' rather longer than she wish'd has agreed so well with here, that she looks quite fat and blooming, and you will say saucy, when I tell you, she had the audacity to say she shou'd not return untill I went to escort her in this instance she has verify'd the old proverb that small people take the greatest liberties. 

Our Br Ben & family were all well a few days since, and going on much in the old way I [be]lieve.

I wish most sincere my dear Br that [text loss] cou'd write oftener and tell me more about [text loss] self, my sister, and the little fellows -as for my Goddaughter, you have never yet told me whether she resembles any of her relations on this side the water, whether or not she possess their loquacity & a number of little incidents of the like nature, which, tho' they may appear trifling, wou'd be very amusing to me, who never expects to get acquainted with those dear connexions any other way than by letter.

Name me affectionately to my sister and tell her I hope to hear by the next letter that she has added another Daughter to her family, as I am sure it wou'd be very pleasing to my little Ann to have a sister to [gain] in her amusements.

All here join in good wishes for you & yours with your affec sister

A Maury

B our Br will thank you to send him some good Turnip seed AM

This is the 16th August and no conveyance for my letter, by which means I have the pleasure to inform you that we had a glorious rain last night which has [reviv'd] all nature AM
