James Maury Esqr

Dear Sir

I duly received your much esteemed favor of the 25th Instant and will attend particularly to the contents. Messrs Fludger &Co are preparing the Cloths as fast as possible, and no doubt will be at Liverpool in good time. 

Mr Rodgers did not object ot have the fine goods put into Hogsheads, he has left London, and will be in Liverpool very soon - the Samples he will also prepair [sic]- I think of increasing the Quantity of Cassimere, and Long Ells a little as they are the best articles, and likely to answer the Canton market well - About the first of next week shall embark for Birmingham, ,and will do the needful there - shall contermand the orders for Hatts, and Castings, as they can be procured better about Liverpool - Am about sending round by water f60 or 70 Dozen, best London Porter for my sea Stores, what I do not Drink, will go to a very good market. 

My Aunt is middling Well, & went to Brighton the day before yesterday to spend some Weeks - she and Mr. Gist joins me in Respectful Compliments to you and your good Lady, wishing you both Joy, and Happiness - Am

Respectfully Dear Sir  
yr friend & obt servt
