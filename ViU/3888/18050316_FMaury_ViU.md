James Maury Esqr

My Dear Brother

I believe my last private letter was dated in the month of August last, of which you have not as yet made mention, but in yours [sent] of the same sort I presume you will - since my residence here I have from motives of Oeconomy, and indeed, till of late of necessity ~~have~~ been compelled to reside intirely in boarding House. I have however found it so extremely inconvenient on several accounts that I have taken a House in which my particular Friend Mr Isaac F. Roe will reside, we know each other well, and I am inclined to believe I shall be much more comfortable than heretofore with any additional expense. You may well suppose how much I have it at Heart to have my Children with me, but for the present I think I should by gratifying myself herein do them the highest injustice, as Eliza & Richard in particular cannot well be more eligibly placed than they are, and I have the satisfaction to believe that both of them are progressing in their improvements in a manner equaling my most sanguine expectations, indeed they are two Charming Sprightly little Fellows.

Albert is for the present with Wm Brooke in Fredericksburg who married the elder Daughter of our Cousin Larkin Smith, who as well as [old] Mrs Brooke are very attentive to him and he goes regularly to school, he is a fine hearty stout fellow. I have lately had two long letters from our Brother Matthew, who seems to think he is geting younger as he says he has encountered the late severe weather with less inconvenience than that of the 1780 and I am pleased from other sources to hear that his Health has been of late very good - from Abram I have scarcely had a letter since my residence here I learn however that they were lately all well in that Quarter - In Spotsylvania there have also been well, except our Brother Thomas who has been much troubled with his old Complaint. With best affection I remain truly

yours

Referring you to the foregoing I have before me your letter of the 31 Jany, by which I am pleased to see how well you have encountered so severe a winter, which certainly has not been equaled in that respect since my recollection, I have however been fortunate enough to get on this far without even experiencing a cold, which I attribute to the good management of my Feed, as I have been obliged to expose myself a good deal during the whole of the winter

I am always pleased at hearing you talk about your sweet little Fellows, and I should like much to see them, of which however there is at present very little prospect - I see how my sister is going *on in the Family way* which is well, for why may you not both live to within Twenty or Thirty years of the age of old Sam Dalton, in which case you may see have a dox more yet to come into the World reared to manhood and if I recollect rightly, you used to wish for about 30 or 40 in number.

I am not an Importer of Brandy but often have it for sale and I will take care to send what you may want, begining with Captain Waite who is quite attentive in cases of this sort - with best affection for you all I remain
