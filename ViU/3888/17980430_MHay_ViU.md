Orange April 30th 98

I have Resumed my Pen to return my Dr Uncle My warmest acknowledgments for his Affectionate letter, and the Package which boath came safe to hand, the detention of your letter in Richmond, together with Ill Health, will I hope prove a sufficient excuse for my seeming inattention, and you will do me the justice to believe, that my Silence has not proceeded from want of Inclination - my Health obliged me to return to Orange shortly after writing you last, where we still reside, and intend to continue with Mamma at the Farm, untill My good Man can fix himself advantageous else where, his presence being absolutely necessary, in this part of the World, for some time at least, as he has undertaken the investigation of the affairs of My Fathers Estate, and wishes if possible in some measure to retrieve the many injurys his Widow and Children have suffered for the want of some Person to act for them, My Uncles all being engaged in Business of their own, the affairs of the Estate have laid dormant till this period, bu which means all the debts due the Estate are now lost, and those due from us have been Dayly accumulateing, in consequence of which we shall only get a small pittance, If I ware the only Person concearned, it would never give me one moments uneaseness, I am only concerned on My Mothers account whose situation is rendered very different from what it ever has been, her only resorce for a mentenance now is, the third part of this little Farm, and one Negro Woman - Uncle Fontaine has I suppose ere this, informed you of the Death of your Worth Mother, who departed this life, on 10th of last Month after a tedious and severe indisposition, though her sences ware so weak and by repeated strokes of the Palsy, that she appeared to be almost in a state of insencibility - I most sincearly congratulate you and My Aunt on the addition to your Family, and that you may be long happy in your growing Family, and [enjoy] a series of uniterrupted happiness, in [wh *text loss*] am joined by my good Man Mamma and [ *text loss* ] remain your

Affectionate Niece
