Fredbg June 25 1810

Dear Sir

Having good reason to believe that unfair and unfounded representations have or will be made to the Executive, with a view to injure the Reputation of my Brother James in his Official Character I take the Liberty to address you on that subject, and to request you to suspend any opinion thereon untill time can be given for investigation which I am persuaded will terminate honorably to the accused and satisfactorily to yourself. I pray you to excuse the liberty I have taken and to be assured that nothing short of a conviction of innocence, on the one part and of Interested views on the other would have induced me to trouble you on a subject of this sort. 

With Sentiments of high Esteem I have the honor to remain

Your Mo Obt S

Fontaine Maury 


James Madison, President of the U.S.
