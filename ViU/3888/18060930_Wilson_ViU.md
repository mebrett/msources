Liverpool 30th Sept 1806

James Maury Esq

Dear Sir

Since your departure there hath been no occurrence out of the common routine of business in the Consular office.

I have at length discover'd the act of Congress Mr Barbour was so anxious to see. It appears to have been passed in the second session of Congress 1790, & to have been extended, with certain modifications, to this time. I have given Mr B a copy.

Should any thing material occur I will take care that you are duly advis'd

With much respect I am  
Your most Ob Servt 

Ed. H Wilson
