My dear Friend

I have your esteemed of the 17th Instant. The Hope is at Phila Live oak & Cedar ship lately repaired & [longthemed] at this place, & made a capital Vessell copper fastened & Copper sheathed. I value her at three thousand pounds - the Cargo, at Seven thousand one hundred - pounds both American property - this Vessell touches at Madeira merely to clear out for the Isle of [Nance] seeing it is not lawful to clear out a Vesell [here] for that place, I still have my doubts about the legality of hte Insurance to the Isle of Nance with liberty to touch at Madeira. Therefore I abandon the idea - Insure then on the best Terms you can the Vessell & Cargo to Madeira only [asking] the underwriters of the offer [time] to another pr the on one policy the Liberty of touch at Madeira on that Risks would not exceed 100 an half per cent if you think it for my Interest as [place] it immediately done on two politices one hence to Madeira only & the other hence to Isle Nance, do so - praying you will take care to avoid offering either to any who are not deemed fair and most honorable in Lloyds.

This Vessell is expected to sail tomorrow

I am yr friend

James Maury
