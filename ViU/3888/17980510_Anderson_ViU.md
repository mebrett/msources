Dear Sir

I beg you will accept my warmest thanks for your obliging information concerning Mr Scott & kind advance of five Guineas to him. I should not have so long delayed my acknowledgments to you but wated in hopes to hear from him, as I much doubted his intention of going to Suffolk on Sunday Eveng. I received a letter dated Belmont House requesting to see me which request I immediately complyed with, & have removed him to a more private situation untill something can be determined on for him. his own wish now is to go into the Army. pardon me for troubling you with family matters & believe me with respectful Compliments to Mrs. Maury Dear Sir

Your much Obliged Friend & srvt
