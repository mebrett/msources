June 9 1805

My Dear Brother

Some time in March I received yours of the 6th of Nov last - This was the more pleasing, as I had not a Right to expected it, from a Consciousness of not deserving it; for I have often reproached myself for my Inattention & Negligence on the Score of writing to the best of brothers. For this I can offer no good Excuse but the want of Health, which I have experienced for near 6 years, which I hope will be deemed as sufficient Apology. This however (I thank God) has been better, since the last fall, than at any period since the Commencement of my Indisposition, & had I more youth on my Side, I might perhaps flatter myself with a perfect Recovery. But after so severe a Shock as my Constitution has received, at my Time of Day, these are hardly grounds for Hope.

Previous to the Receipt of your Letter, I had been informed by Fontaine of your Indisposition, & am pleased to hear from so good Authority as yourself, that it has eventuated so favorably to your Health. May you long continue to enjoy it, not only for your own sake, but also that of your rising Family! You gratify me with the favorable Account you give me of my Nephews, particularly my namesake, who you say so much resembles his Grandfather. I most sincerely wish he may prove as good & respectable a Man. At your stage of Life I doubt not but some painful Reflections some times occur from the [Improbability] of your seeing your Children reared to a confirmed state of Manhood, & such Maturity of Judgement as might secure them a a comfortable & respectable Passage thru Life. These Reflections are natural & have their due weight. But however it is wrong to indulge them in Anticipation so far as to produce any permanent [Disquietude] of Mind. Rather hope you may live as long & enjoy strength of mind, as your old Acquaintances Mr.s Davis & Dalton (about whom you so particularly enquire) have done. The former of these I saw three or four days ago at his own House (for I have made it a Rule for many years past to pay him a visit every spring & fall at least, till prevented by want of Health) his mind is still strong, but his bodily Powers much impaired. I think he cannot stay long with us. At parting he took a very affectionate & affecting leave & told me he expected it was to be his last Farewell. I named you to him as you desired in your Letter. He seemed gratifyed with your Attention & desired a Return of the Complements. He is in his 84th year. On the same trip I also heard from Mr Dalton by his son William, who had not long since been to see him. He is 20 years older than Mr Davis, & a much heartier Man. He now rides & walks a great Deal, & has for several years till the last attended to his Plantation Business himself without any Overseer. This you will say is an extraordinary Instance of Vigor & Strength at his Age. This and more other instances of longevity which occur in this Quarter have convinced me that the part of [our] country from a little below the Southwest Mountains to the foot of the Blue Ridge may be considered as the Montpelier of America - As a proof of this I will [sketch] to you the Ages of several, whom you once knew & may still remember. There is living in about 3 miles of me a Benjamin Pharis aged a hundred & six - whose age is registered - a hearty Man, saving that he has lost his Sight. his wife dyed last Winter aged 95. Old Micajah Clark, whom you remember, is in his 88th year - quite hearty & strong, [still] hunts kills deer. Robert Johnson between 95 & 100. Benjamin Speed 86, who still keeps school & is ~~still~~ in high Repute in his Line. Robert Sharpe 99 - John Thomas whom you well remember, is considerably above 86, & several times last summer walked 5 or 6 miles across the Mountains to my lower church. Old Mrs More is also still living & is about 90 years old. There are also several others I could name within a few miles between 80 & 90 years old. But there is an Instance of Longevity in the Clarkson family (some of whom you must remember about Carr's Low grounds) which if you will take Numbers into Consideration, is still more extraordinary. Of these there were 8 brothers & 5 sisters raised to be Men & Women - two of which (sisters) have dyed within less than two years - ~~the others~~ about midway between the oldest & youngest - the other eleven are living, & the youngest of them ~~are still~~ is sixty years old - this is a Fact not to be contested. & perhaps not to be paralleled in the World.

I mentioned above, that my own health has been better since last fall, than for nearly 6 years, since which I have believe I have never been 30 Miles from Home except a trip to the Springs, till last Month, when I ventured to Richmond to attend the Convention of the Episcopal Church of this State. On this Occassion there were near forty Members convened of whom my Colleagues Col John Walker (for the Convention consists of a Lay Member, with the Minister of each Paris) was the oldest Man, & myself the oldest Clergyman. Of the Clergy there were upwards of 20 in Convention, of whom Mr Waugh & Mr Bracken were the only two in Orders before the Revolution except myself. This circumstance afforded ample Matter for moralizing on the [fugam Temporis & Vito Brevitatem] Whilst at Richmond I lodged in the same House with Judges Lyson, Carrington, & Fleming - It was pleasing to see three men of their Ages so hearty & cheerful. They all inquired after you & desired to be named to you.    Col Fontaine our Relation was a Member of the Convention, who informed me you had applyed to him for the History of our Family written by our Great Grandfather Fontaine, which was in my Possession, & desired me to forward it to you. I yesterday sent it by a trusty waggoner to the Care of Overton Anderson with a Request to him to forward it to you by the first safe Conveyance.

In a Letter to some of the Family you desire to be informed of the ages of our Grandfathers & Grandmothers - I think Nancy has given you the Register of our Grandfather Walkers Age - I know he dyed in his 32d year, as did his Brothers, Thomas & Benjamin. Our Grandmother Tunstall was born in 1705 & dyed 1788 - Our grandfather Maurys I know dyed in 1751; and I think I remember to hear our father say he was in his 71st year.
