Liverpool 17th Aug 1796

My Dear Sir

Yesterday I delivered your letter to Miss Walke as you desired.

From the best information I have been able to obtain, it appear that it will not be necessary for you to undergo the fatigue and trouble of formally sitting to receive any visitors, but at the same time it is consistent with what is practiced in the fashionable circles to give notice to your friends, on what day, or days you wish them to pay their respects in this case it is not expected that _you) will be at home, but the Bride receives the visiters in a less formal stile than what was formerly practiced.

Mr. Hughes joins me in wishing you every possible happiness.

With much respect I am My Dear Sir your obliged Servt

Wm. M. Duncan
