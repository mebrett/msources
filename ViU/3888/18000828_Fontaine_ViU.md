My Dear Brother

Since my Letter of the 12 July it hath pleased Heaven to take from me my greatest conslater under all my difficulties. On the 22 Instant my beloved Betsey was delivered of a Fine Hearty Daughter and in one hour afterwards, bid me a final Farewell, this truly afflicting and unexpected event is the only one of many in my life that I have found much difficulty in meeting with becoming Fortitude, but it being so immediately preceded by my pecuniary difficulties, I have you who hath experienced both situations to judge how far it must have shaken one whose affections had for 21 years been fixed on one of the very best of Women. The Children join in best affections for you & yours with your truly afflicted Brother
